// you create objects, make them follow a template using classes -these classes are blueprint of that object
// similarly if u want an object to follow a template in JS  this is don by prototypes


// they let you create behaviour that affects many objects


// objects are not class based in JS

// JS OBJECTS don't own methods, they have properties that can be function

// whenever a function is created  two objects are reated - one is the function object  itself

// and other is the prototype object
// what s the point of prototype object


// function foo()
// two objects foo and foo.protototype


// __proto__ property object is created for every 



// a prototype object is created 


// if a property is searched on an object it check for that property on that object first and if that 
// property id not found then it checks for that property in the prototype object
// implicit property lookup

// using this you can imply same behaviuor to multiple objects as long as they are created from same function


// when you have objects and you want to build behaviour for that objects you use prototype
