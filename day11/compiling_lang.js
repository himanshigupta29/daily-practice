console.log('========== hi ===============');

console.log(.a);


// hi is not printed
// intead
// code throws syntax error
// because this is not the correct way of writing JS code
// line 3 has . (dot before a)
// this means first the complete code is compliled 
// then sent to the machine to run the optimized code
